LaTeX thesis template for University of Copenhagen

Combined with the backgrounds for the different KU departments from http://www.math.ku.dk/~m00cha/ provided by the (included) `ku-coverpage` repo, you can use it as a thesis title page template for any department.

# Example

1. Clone this repo.
2. In `main.tex`, adjust the paths to match your department.
3. Work from there to adjust the template to your needs.

If there is no header background file for your department, create it based on one of the .doc files included in `ku-coverpage`.

# Credits

The template was created by Klaus B. J. at DIKU/KU ([@kbj](https://github.com/kbj)) and just generalized here.
